Current Migration Status and Issues
====================================

Problem Description:
------------------
We are working on fixing database migration issues in the Venezia application. The main problems are:
1. Table names need to be consistently plural (e.g., 'store' to 'stores')
2. Foreign key constraints need to be updated to reference the new table names
3. We're encountering errors when trying to modify existing tables and constraints

Current State:
-------------
1. Models have been updated to use plural table names (__tablename__ = 'stores', etc.)
2. Previous migration attempts failed with errors:
   - "table already exists" when trying to create new tables
   - "no such constraint" when trying to modify foreign keys
3. Latest migration file (fix_table_names.py) attempts to:
   - Drop and recreate foreign key constraints
   - Update table references

Database Tables That Need Updates:
--------------------------------
- stores (from store)
- sales (from sale)
- products (from product)
- product_categories (from product_category)
- providers (from provider)
- recipes (from recipe)
- ingredients (from ingredient)
- users (from user)
- productions (from production)
- delivery_orders (from delivery_order)
- delivery_statuses (from delivery_status)
- delivery_addresses (from delivery_address)

Next Steps Needed:
----------------
1. Verify current database schema and existing constraints
2. Create a clean migration that will:
   a. Handle existing data
   b. Update table names if needed
   c. Update foreign key constraints
3. Test migration with both upgrade and downgrade paths
4. Ensure all application features still work after migration

Note: The database is SQLite, which has limitations on ALTER TABLE operations. We may need to use batch_alter_table or create temporary tables for some operations.
