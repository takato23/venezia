# Troubleshooting Guidelines

When reporting an issue, please provide the following information to help diagnose the problem quickly:

1. Browser Console Output:
   - Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
   - Check the Console tab for any error messages
   - Copy and share any relevant errors or warnings

2. Network Tab Information:
   - In developer tools, go to the Network tab
   - Perform the action that's causing the issue
   - Note the request URL, method (GET/POST), and response status
   - Check if the response contains any error messages

3. Comparison Points:
   - If a similar feature works (e.g., if providers delete works but products don't)
   - Mention the working feature so we can compare implementations

4. Database-Related Issues:
   - For deletion problems: Check if the item might have related records
   - For creation/update issues: Note any validation errors
   - For query issues: Share any SQL errors from the console

5. UI/Display Issues:
   - Screenshot or description of what you're seeing vs what you expect
   - Any specific user interactions that trigger the issue
   - Browser and screen size if relevant

# Technical Stack & Dependencies

1. Frontend Framework:
   - AdminLTE 3.2.0
   - Bootstrap 4.6.2
   - jQuery 3.6.0 (required by AdminLTE)
   - Font Awesome (included in AdminLTE)

2. Script Loading Order:
   - Scripts that define functions used in HTML must be loaded in the head section
   - Order matters: Load libraries before custom scripts that depend on them
   - Example order:
     1. jQuery 3.6.0
     2. Bootstrap 4.6.2 (bootstrap.bundle.min.js)
     3. AdminLTE 3.2.0
     4. Custom functions used in HTML attributes (onclick, etc.)

# Known Solutions

1. Product Deletion:
   - Products with related records in Stock or StockHistory are not actually deleted
   - They are marked as inactive (is_active = False) instead
   - This is intentional to maintain data integrity
   - Solution: Use the status filter to hide inactive products if needed

2. JavaScript Function Availability:
   - Issue: "ReferenceError: function is not defined" when using onclick attributes
   - Cause: Functions used in HTML onclick attributes must be defined before they're called
   - Solution: Move function definitions to the head section, after loading all required libraries
   - Example:
     ```html
     <head>
         <!-- Load libraries first -->
         <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
         <script src="bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
         
         <!-- Then define functions used in HTML -->
         <script>
             function deleteProduct(id) {
                 // Function code here
             }
         </script>
     </head>
     ```

3. Bootstrap Modal Issues:
   - Issue: Modals not showing up when clicking trigger buttons
   - Common Causes:
     1. Using wrong Bootstrap version attributes:
        - Bootstrap 5 uses: data-bs-toggle="modal" and data-bs-target="#modalId"
        - Bootstrap 4 uses: data-toggle="modal" and data-target="#modalId"
     2. Missing Bootstrap JS:
        - Bootstrap's JavaScript must be loaded after jQuery
        - Check if bootstrap.bundle.min.js is included
     3. Incorrect event binding:
        - Bootstrap 4 uses .modal() and show.bs.modal events
        - Example:
          ```javascript
          $('#myModal').on('show.bs.modal', function(event) {
              const button = $(event.relatedTarget);
              const data = button.data('some-attribute');
          });
          ```
